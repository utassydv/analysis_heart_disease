This repository contains the solution of individual assignment of David Utassy for courses Data Analysis 2 and Coding with R at the Central European University on the program MS in Business Analytics.


This repository analyzes the hearth disease dataset from Kaggle [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset), it is from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long each. The original data source is the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease), which contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them.
