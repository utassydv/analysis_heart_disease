This dataset is hosted on Kaggle [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset), it is from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long each. The original data source is the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease), which contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them, so as mine.  

Both raw and clean folders contain the same data, as it was clean already on Kaggle.

The data contains 1025 patientsâ€™ attributes and whether they have heart disease or not. See more in the subfolders' variable.xlsx.
